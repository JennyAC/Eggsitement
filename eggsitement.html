                <p>Every year, on Easter Sunday, my family (plus a pile of extras we've 'adopted' over the years) gathers together to decorate eggs. It's a noisy, crazy messy day and I love it!</p>
                <p>In the beginning, when I was a small child, my brothers and sisters and I would decorate boiled eggs and then eat them. Over the years, though, we all got a bit too good at it, and soon the eggs were getting too good to smash. My parents decided to start blowing the eggs so that we could keep our masterpieces.</p>
                <p>The collection of eggs - painted, dyed, waxed, mosaiced, drilled and who-knows-what-else - has now grown to well over 1,000 eggs, all of come out to be displayed each year. Somehow though, each year, people still manage to come up with something new!</p>

                <h2>Dying an egg - the simple version</h2>
                <p>One of the easiest ways to decorate eggs is to dip them in coloured dye, a tradition that still happens in many cultures today. At Greek Easter, boiled eggs are dyed, traditionally with red dye, and then family members bump eggs together to see who has the strongest egg. The last egg standing is the winner.</p>
                <p>Dyeing gives even the youngest or most unskilled artist a chance to create something beautiful, as colours blend and and change with multiple dips.</p>
                <h3>Now's your chance to try dying your own egg!</h3>
                <p>Click on a pot of dye to change the colour of your egg. Once you've dipped, you can dip again or click on the egg to change it back to its original colour.</p>

                <h2>And then there are the more complex ways to dye...</h2>
                <p>Initially simple, dyed eggs can get a whole lot more interesting when you start involving other materials!</p>
                <div id="rubber-bands">
                <p>Over the years, we've experimented with many different ways to dip eggs. The egg on the left was dyed yellow, then had fresh parsley held on to it with with an old stocking before dipping in green dye. we've also used string, stickers, crayon and wax to give interesting effects when dipped.</p>

It can be great fun eggsperimenting with different things to block out the dye.</p>

                <p><img src="images/egg-photos/vegemite.jpg" title="Ruth's vegemite egg" class="floatright">This vegemite egg  was decorated using a Ukrainian tool called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pysanka" title="link to Wikipedia article on pysanky">pysanka</a>, a pencil-like handle with a tiny metal funnel which you fill with beeswax. You hold the funnel over a candle to melt the wax then start drawing with it, allowing you to create complex designs (if you are very patient!). First step was to cover the areas that should stay white with wax. The egg was then dipped in yellow dye then more wax was applied to cover everything that should stay yellow. The egg was dipped in red, then more wax again to coverthe red, then more wax and finally black dye.</p>
                <p>The order of dye-colours you dip is very important, going from lightest (the white of the egg itself) to darkest as the blends overlay and create new colours.</p>
                <p>The final step is to heat the egg slowly over a candle flame and carefully melt off all the wax.</p>

                     <img src="images/egg-photos/hedgehog.png" class="floatright grow"><p>Over the years, people have added many weird and wonderful extras on to their eggs. The egg that we think is the oldest (made before we started writing dates on them) was made by dripping melted wax from a candle onto the egg to make it into a hedgehog.</p>
                     <p>The mosaic feature egg for this section was made by gluing on tiny pieces from eggs that had been dropped while being painted (a terrible event - the awful crunch as an egg hits the table brings a gasp to everyone's lips). As you can imagine, gluing on that many tiny bits took a long time - 4 years, in fact!</p>
                     <p>Since then we have had hats, fishy fins and tails, string, fluffy chickens, foil, paper, alphabet pasta, knitting, crochet and even zippers. Most of the eggs get packed away neatly back into egg cartons after Easter, but the storage of eggs with extra add-ons can be quite a challenge. At least the crocheted ones have built-in padding!</p>
